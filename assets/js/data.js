    "faith": ["faith",`We all understand that:
        <ul>
            <li>Faith is the gateway to a world of triumph (Heb.11:33,1John 5:4).</li>
            <li> Faith is the master key to a world of unlimitedpossibilities (Matt.17:20).</li>
            <li>Faith is an unstoppable force in the world of  the spirit (Eph.6:16).</li>
            <li>Faith is the force that rules over the world of impossibilities (Jer.11:40).</li>
            <li>Faith is the force behind all supernatural manifestations (Dan.3:28;6:23,Act 3:16;14:8-11).</li>
        </ul>
        
    However, it is ONLY to everyone according to his faith (Matt.9:28).
    Remember the original mandate of this ministry is still the same:
    </br>
    <i>
        <b>
            “Now the hour has come to liberate the world from all oppression of the devil
            through the preaching of the word of faith, and I am sending you to undertake this task”
        </b>
    </i>
    </br>
    The word of faith therefore remains the anchor message of this commission.
    </br>
    Infact, it is also the very core of the kingdom life.

    Faith is therefore the key to everything in the kingdom. All that Jesus has provided for us in redemption is obtainable only by faith. (Heb 6:12,IIPeter 1:3).
    </br>
    It is therefore very clear that we cannot receive any thing from God except by faith. (James 1:5-6,Mk 11:24).
    </br>
    Our security on earth is also impossible without faith (Eph6:16). Therefore, everything in the kingdom answers to faith.
    </br>
    This must be the reason why the redeemed are called BELIEVERS`

    "word": ["The Word",`Speaking to Martha in Luke’s gospel Jesus said:
        </br>
    <b><i>
        "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."
    </i></b> Luke10:41-42
    </br>
    From the above scripture Jesus is saying “the word” is the most valuable asset to every believer. How is this so you may ask ?
        <ul>
            <li>God has exalted His word above His name <i>.....for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.</i> Ps.138:2, (see alsoPh.2:9-11)</li>
            <li>All things are at the command of His word <i>.... and upholding all things by the word of his power....</i> Heb.1:3</li>
            <li>The word is the master key to a world of impact and exploits. The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel Is.9:8(see alsoIs.60:1-22,Ps.45:3-5)</li>
            <li>The word is the healing balm with divine capacity to deal with all manner of sickness and disease. <i> The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. Matt.8:8 </i>(seealsoPs.107:20,Job33:21-25)</li>
            <li>The word is the custodian for all supernatural manifestations. <i>And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, where with thou shalt do signs</i> Ex.4:17(seealsoMk.16:20,Acts14:3)</li>
            <li>It is very clear from all the above that the word is the gateway to a world of signs and wonders. Remember the scriptures cannot be broken and that heaven and earth shall pass away but not a jot of His word shall pass away. (John.10:35,Matt.24:35).</li>
        </ul>
By the revelation and the engagement of the truth, everyone’s supernatural triumph is guaranteed for life. (IICor.2:14)
</br>
A majestic ride in this kingdom will always demand adequate depth in the truth(Ps.45:3-5).
</br>
It is not therefore the absence of light that gets us frustrated, it is the absence of adequate light!
</br>
For instance, there is matchstick light, there is candle light, there is electric bulb light, there is fluorescent tube light and there is also flood light. Light is light you may say, but it is obvious that it varies in intensity. One could have light in the room and still be frustrated in a search for a missing item if the  light is not adequate.
</br>
This is inline with scriptures:
<i>"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory(1Cor.15:41).</i>
</br>
I have often said that one must never mistake his condition for his portion. Therefore, arise; get into the word for a change of story.
Arise; getup, the word of God is still in force on the earth today.(Pr.4:8)

    "prayer": ["Prayer",`'Prayer is both a platform for provoking divine intervention and supernatural  transformation. This is why it is designed to be a part of the believer’s daily life.
        </br>
    Furthermore, we  recognize among other things that the altar of prayer is:
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Altar of Grace Heb.4:16</b> 
        </br>
        And we know that grace is the cure for all forms of disgrace</li>
        <li><b>The Altar of Divine Secrets Jer.33:3, Ps. 119:18, Deut. 29:29, James 1:5,6; Dan. 2:16-19, Job 29:1-10. </b>
        </br>
        And divine secret is the master key to a world of success. </li>
        <li><b>The Altar of Command 1Kg.17:1, James5:17-18, 1Kg.18:36-39, Isa.45:11, Matt.17:21.</b>
        Elijah was a man of command when he said:
        </br>
        <i>“ as the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.”
        (1Kings.17:1). But he was a man of prayer.</li>
        <li><b>The Altar of Deliverance Acts 12:5-11, Acts 16:25-26. </b>
        </br>
        You can pray your chains off and your iron gates open.</li>
        <li><b>The Altar of Victory Isa. 25:8,1Cor. 15:54-57,1Cor. 15:26,  2Kg. 4:32-36(33), Isa. 38:1-6(2), John 11:29-44(40), Acts 9:36-41 </b>
        </br>
        Victory over the hottest forms  of spiritual battles is granted on the altar of prayer.</li>
        <li><b>The Altar of Remembrance (1Sam.1:9-20,Isa.43:26) </b>
        </br>
        God remembered Hannah in response to her prayer (1Sam.1:10,19). <i>I have asked him of the Lord – 1Sam. 1:20</i>
        </li>
    </ul>

We also recognize that the altar of prayer is the altar of change:
<ol>
    <li>Nothing changes a man like divine presence and prayer provides a platform for divine presence (Heb.4:16/Ps.84:7)</li>
    <li>Prayer changes things – IIChr.4:9-10,Is.38:1-5</li>
    <li>Prayer changes Nations – IIChr.7:14,IIChr.15:3-19</li>
    <li>Prayer heals the sick – James5:14-15,Is.30:18-20</li>
    <li>Prayer changes people – Lk.9:28-35,IICor.3:18,Ps.84:7</li>
    <li>Prayer guarantees access to divine direction – IISam.5:18-22,Ezra.8:21-23</li>
    <li>Prayer sanctifies – IJohn2:9-11,John17:17</li>
    <li>Prayer and fasting opens us up to revelations in the scriptures – Ps.119:18,Is.58:8-10,Lk.11:2-4,/Duet.8:13</li>
</ol>

We are told to pray without ceasing – IThess.5:16
</br>
Also that men ought always to pray and not to faint –Lk.18:1-2
</br>
And praying always with all prayers and supplication in the Spirit – Eph.6:18
</br>
Therefore, prayer is not designed as a rescue scheme but a lifestyle – Matt.6:5-7/16-18.
</br>
It is an all time affair for any believer that desires to live a victorious life`
    ],

    "consecration": ["Consecration",` 
        <ul>
            <li>Consecration is essentially about being separated unto God (Joshua24:15)</li>
            <li> It is the pursuit of the heart of God. (Psalm63:8)</li>
            <li>It is letting God occupy the center of one’s heart. (Proverbs23:26)</li>
            <li>It is giving God the first place in one’s life. (Mathew6:33)</li>
            <li>It is the inner reverence and adoration for God. (Isa.29:13)</li>
            <li>It is the heart-borne desire to always please God above all else. (Ph.1:21,Rms.8:35-38)</li>
            <li>It is the hot love of God in the inner man. (Rev.3:16)</li>
        </ul>
No wonder the Bible asserts; love is the fulfilling of the law, (Romans13:10).
</br>
The love of God in a man’s heart is therefore the platform for true consecration. It is not just saying, ‘I love you Lord’ or singing the love of God, it is living it out. (1John3:17,18).
The love of God without proofs is fake (IJohn4:20,21)
</br>
We all understand that the separation of man from God was the beginning of man’s adventure in frustration. Therefore, man’s enviable destiny cannot be restored until our union with God is established. Isaiah the prophet proclaimed that our iniquities have separated between us and God (Isaiah59:1-2).
</br>
This is the very core of the mission of JesusChrist to take away the sins of the world (Matt.1:21).
</br>
After Adam sinned, he was driven out of the Garden of Eden, and separated from God. It is therefore sin that constitutes a barrier between man and  God. But the fall of Adam was purely machinated by the devil (Gen.3:1-7,2Cor.11:3).
</br>
However,we understand that the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all unrighteousness (1John1:7) and also that the Spirit of God is what empowers us to walk in His righteousness (Rom.8:13).
</br>
In  scriptures, the Holy Spirit is revealed in many ways such as:
<ul>
    <li>The Spirit of Holiness (Rom.1:4) That empowers us to live a holy life.</li>
    <li>The Refiners's Fire whose ministry is to purge and purify the sons of Levi that they might offer sacrifices in righteousness (Mal.3:1-4).</li>
    <li>The Unquenchable Fire that burns off all the chaff from our lives (Matt.3:11-13).</li>
</ul>

I do not think it is possible to live a life that is pleasing unto God without engaging the help of the Holy Spirit. The Bible asserts;
</br>
<i>" For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</i> (Rom8:13).
</br>
Paul, a man with a deep fellowship with the Holy Spirit testifies:
</br>
<i>Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved
ourselves among you that believe </i>(1Thess2:10).</br>

I believe that Paul’s understanding of the mystery of iniquity must have been what gave him mastery over sin (2Thess.2:3-13).
</br>
But hear what Paul has to say:
</br>
<i>...
I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also...I speak with tongues more than ye all (1Cor.14:14-18). </i>
</br>
As I have often said, the secrets of men are in their stories.The above scripture helps us to understand the secrets behind the victory of Paul over sin. He was consistently fanning the fire tokeep all works of evil off his domain by praying extensively in the spirit among other things.
</br>
Remember the Word says in Jude 20:
</br>
<i>But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost. </i>
</br>
We definitely need the fire of the Holy Ghost to live a holy life.
    `],
    
    "prosperity": ["Prosperity",`The world today continues to face the fulfillment of the age long prophecies of economic gloom as foretold severally in scriptures.
<br />
    Forinstance,weunderstandfromscripturesthat:
<ul>
    <li>Economic downturn is not new (Gen.47:15-23)</li>
    <li>Economic melt down is prophetic (Malachi4:1-2)</li>
    <li>Economic depression has always been in biblical history (2kings6:24-30)</li>
</ul>

Christ stated categorically that there shall be famine in the last days.
<br />
<b><i> And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass: but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall
be famines, and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places </i>
(Mathew24:6-7).</b>
<br />

The present global economic melt down is therefore a fulfillment ofprophecy but God has also drawn a programme of exemption for His children as contained in His word:
<br />
<b><i> For behold the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn the mup ,saith
 the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name, shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings: and ye shall go forth and grow up as claves of the stall </i>
(Malachi4:1-2)</b>
<br />

And the Psalmist also said:
<br />
<b><i>
The Lord knoweth the days of the upright; and their inheritance shall be forever.
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied</i>
(Psalm37:18-19).</b>
<br />

Other reference (Psalm33:18-19).
<ul>
    <li>We saw famine in the days of Abraham but God exempted him. (Gen12:1-4,10&Gen13:1-2).</li>
    <li>There was also famine in the days of Isaac but it did not touch him.(Gen26:1&12-14).</li>
    <li>In the days of Jacob, there was also famine on the earth but Jacob never felt it.(Gen42:1-3,43:1-2&11-12).</li>
</ul>
<br />

All our covenant fathers did not only survive the famine in their days but they were in command in the time of famine. They had resources to match the challenges of their hardtimes. Thank God we still serve a covenant keeping God. Every covenant practitioner will not only survive this economic drought but shall be in supernatural command of supplies all through the season!
<br />
It is therefore time to take total cover in the covenant and to abide in a deep and rich fellowship with God. 
The church of Christ is our endtime city of refuge; it is our covenant shelter against this gloomy economic depression.
<br />

TheBiblesays:
<br />
<b><i>
For the Lord hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for His habitation. This is my rest forever; here will I dwell for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provision; I will
satisfy her poor with bread </i>
(Psalm132:13-16).</b>
<br />
Other reference (Psm92:12-15).
The church is our covenant place of blessing. That is, to enjoy the showers of blessing needed for these hardtimes, the church is the place to belong and to abide. (Ezek.34:26).
<br />
We are about to begin to experience the reality of divine providence, Kingdom-order of prosperity and supernatural wealth after the order of Abraham .(Gen24:1,Isaiah51:1-3)
<br />
Every story of financial fortune in scriptures is rooted in a great heart for God.
<ul>
    <li> It is a heart for God that puts a believer in command of gold.</li>
    <li>A heart for God leads to a boom, but a heart for gold leads to a gloom.</li>
    <li>A heart for God is the gateway to financial fortune, but a heart for gold has tens to the grave. (ITim6:10,Ps.102:13-15)</li>
    <li>Solomon loved the Lord and he gained command of gold (IKing3:3-13).</li>
    <li>David was a man after God’s own heart; he also had custody of financial fortune. IChro.29:3-6)</li>
    <li>Abraham so loved the Lord that he was called the friend of God; and he was also so wealthy that he had a private army.(Gen.14:14-19)</li>
</ul>

It should also be noted that prosperity is a vital tool for supernatural church growth.
<br />
<b><i>
“
Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad;”</i>
(Zech1:17)</b>
<br />

This is why the testimony of changed lives is clearly a tool for drawing souls to Christ. God empowers His people for financial fortune, so that He can use their financial fortune to draw many into His Kingdom.
<br />
<b><i>
“
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men
 shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of
 him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.
”
</i>
(Zech.8:23)</b>
Furthermore, it is a known fact that prosperity attracts but poverty dispels.
        `],

    "vision": ["Vision",`We all know that we serve a God of plan and purpose. And His plan for us is settled in heaven forever. Therefore, locating God’s plan for one’s life is the foundation for true fulfillment.
<br />

    Back in 1977, I came across a verse of scripture that turned my life around dramatically. God said,
<br />
<b><i>
for I know the plan that I have for you says the Lord, a plan of welfare and not of evil to give you a future and a hope. </i>Jer.29:11(RSV)</b>
<br />

Speaking to me from this scripture, God said,
"My son, your future is in my plan not in your plan and until you discover my plan and pursue it, you don’t have a future."
<br />
Remember , Godsaid,
<br />
<b><i>
I am the Lord I change not</i>(Mal3:6)</b>

<ul>
    <li>He had a plan for Jeremiah before he was born – Jer.1:5</li>
    <li>He separated Paul to the gospel while he was yet in his mother’s womb – Gal1:15-16</li>
</ul>

Surely, God has a plan for all his children. And as we all know that you don’t determine the purpose of a product after it has arrived in the market; it must have been decided right from the factory. In the same vein, God’s plan and purpose for everyone 
of us has been fully packaged before we arrived here on earth and all we need is to discover and pursue the same.
<br />
We further understand from scriptures that everychild of God is a child of destiny. As it is written;
<br />
<b><i>
For whom he did foreknow, heal so did predestinate to be conformed to the image
 of his Son, that he might be the first born among many brethren. Moreover whom he
 did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and
 whom he justified, them he also glorified.</i>Rom8:29—30 </b>
(Seealso,Rom9:10-24)
<br />

From the above scripture, every child of God is predestinated to be glorified. We have been called unto glory and honour (2Pet1:3).
<br />
We have an enviable destiny (Gen26:14, Gal4:28).
<br />
We are to be envied and not to be pitied. (1Pet2:9)
<br />
Therefore accessing God’s plan is the gateway to a glorious destiny. We must recognize that we serve a God of preordination (Jer.1:5); a God of
 predestination (Rom.9:10-14); a God who knows the end from the beginning (Is.46:9-10)
<br />
We must also recognize that we serve a God of times and seasons who appoints ‘ weeks of harvest for his people ’ (Eccl.3:1-11;Jer.5:24)

<br />
Also, we are saved today because He has ordained us unto eternal life (Acts13:48)
 and we are redeemed because He has predestined us unto salvation (Rm.8:29-30)
<br />
In the same way God has reserved blessings for all His children, but we must be led to where these blessings are waiting (Ps.47:4;1Pet.1:4).
<br />
God led Abraham to where his blessings were waiting and he got through to them (Gen.12:1-4;13:2;24:1).
<br />
God also led Isaac to where his enviable blessings were and inspite of all oppositions,he realized them (Gen.26:1-14)
<br />
When we allow God to lead us, He leads us to where He has prepared a table for us, where our cups will be full and running over, where our enemies will be rendered totally
 helpless and where goodness and mercy only shall be following us (Ps.23:1-6).
<br />
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of
 death (Pro.14;12&16:25)

We must therefore reposition ourselves to the benefit of the leading of the Spirit of
 God so we can gain access to our blessings.
<br />
But remember, only the spiritual can be spiritually led (Rev.1:10;ICor.2:14) and only
 the meek can be guided (Pro.25:9;Matt.5:5).
<br />
I believe as we remain spiritually sensitive to His leadings, He will guide us with His
 hands to where our supernatural blessings are waiting (Ps.32:8;Jer:48:17)

        `],

    "wisdom": ["Wisdom",`
            <p>The Bible says in <b>Dan. 12:3</b>:<br>
"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever."<br><br>

Wisdom is said to be the principal thing in the book of Proverbs (<b>Prov. 4:7-11</b>). It goes on to say, when we embrace wisdom, it shall promote (change our position for the better). It goes further to say, a crown of glory shall she deliver unto us and an ornament of grace.<br><br>

From the above, it is clear that glory is one of the products of wisdom. Paul the Apostle, in his epistle to the Corinthians, said:<br>
<b>"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory" (1 Cor. 2:6-7)</b>.<br><br>

However, there are four kinds of wisdom as outlined in the epistle of James:<br>
<b>"This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy" (James 3:15-17)</b>.<br><br>

From the above scripture, we can classify wisdom into four categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Earthly</b> – natural wisdom, what we call common sense. You don’t have to learn how to eat, drink or sleep; they are all common-sense issues.</li>
  <li>Then we have <b>intellectual wisdom</b> – sensual. This is what we go to school to acquire in various disciplines – engineering, technology, social sciences, humanities, law, etc.</li>
  <li>Then we have <b>devilish</b> wisdom which talks about occultic, diabolical wisdom.</li>
  <li>And finally, we have the <b>wisdom from above</b>, which is the wisdom of God, and remember the Bible says whatever is from above is above all (<b>John 3:31</b>). The wisdom of God is superior to all other kinds of wisdom because it is from above.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our access to this wisdom is clearly outlined in scriptures:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is for the redeemed (<b>Matt. 11:19</b>). The child of a goat possesses the wisdom of a goat. The child of a duck possesses the wisdom of the duck. The child of a cow possesses the wisdom of a cow, and so on and so forth. This is why only the children of God can access the wisdom of God.</li>
  <li>We access this wisdom by prayer, <b>"If anyone lack wisdom, let him ask of God..." (James 1:5)</b>. Also, we saw Daniel take delivery of divine wisdom through prayer (<b>Dan. 2:16-19</b>).</li>
  <li>We also access this wisdom through learning. <b>"A wise man shall hear and increase learning" (Prov. 1:5)</b>. Wisdom has been defined as the correct application of knowledge. That means knowledge is the raw material for the production of wisdom. Concerning Timothy, Paul wrote:<br>
     <b>"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus" (2 Tim. 3:15)</b>.</li>
  <li>Furthermore, we access divine wisdom through meditation (<b>Ps. 119:97-100</b>):<br>
     <b>"O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me. I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts."</b><br>
     And through the process of meditation David said, <b>"You have made me wiser than my enemies. I have more understanding than all my teachers."</b> Meditation is key to operating in divine wisdom.</li>
  <li>And finally, through keeping wise company. <b>"He that walks with the wise shall be wise, but a companion of fools shall be destroyed" (Prov. 13:20)</b>. How? <b>Iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance (wisdom) of his friends" (Prov. 27:17)</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Proofs of divine wisdom at work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It is Creative:<br>
     <b>"O LORD, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches" (Ps. 104:24; Prov. 3:19)</b>.</li>
  <li>It commands exploits (<b>Matt. 13:54; Mk. 6:2</b>).</li>
  <li>It stabilizes (<b>Isa. 33:6; Mk. 7:27-28</b>).<br>
      Operating by divine wisdom is building on the rock; the wind and storms and the rain notwithstanding, the building shall remain.</li>
</ol>

        `],


    "supernatural": ["The Supernatural",`
        <p>We consider signs and wonders as spiritual tools for supernatural turnaround in the lives of men and women. It is written,<br>
<b>"And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders: And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey" (Deut. 26:6-8)</b>.<br>
(also <b>Ps. 105:26-38</b>)<br><br>

We also recognize that signs and wonders are the heritage of the redeemed of the Lord. Jesus said,<br>
<b>"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is everyone that is born of the Spirit" (John 3:8)</b>.<br>
(also <b>Mk. 16:17-18</b>; <b>Isa. 8:18</b>)<br><br>

But according to the Holy Scriptures, we do not wait for miracles, we work them!<br>
<b>"And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs" (Exo. 4:17)</b>.<br>
(also <b>1 Cor. 12:10</b>)<br><br>

We also understand that God’s word is the spiritual raw material for the working of miracles.<br>
<b>"Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands" (Acts 14:3)</b>.<br>
(also <b>Ps. 107:20</b>; <b>Matt. 8:8</b>; <b>Lk. 5:1-5, 17</b>)<br><br>

However, faith is the spiritual activator of the virtue for signs and wonders. Jesus said to the two blind men that cried after Him for their miracle,<br>
<b>"...Believe ye that I am able to do this?" They said unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. And their eyes were opened" (Matt. 9:28-30)</b> paraphrased.<br>
(also <b>Mk. 6:5</b>; <b>Mk. 9:23</b>; <b>Jn. 11:44</b>)<br><br>

All through scriptures, obedience of faith has been clearly defined as the gateway to the miraculous.<br>
At Cana in Galilee, Mary said,<br>
<b>"Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it..."</b> and as they did, water was turned into wine. (<b>John 2:5-11</b>)<br><br>

Jesus also told the man that was born blind,<br>
<b>"Go; wash in the pool of Siloam..."</b> He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. (<b>John 9:7</b>)<br><br>

Again, Jesus, after His resurrection, stood on the shore, although His disciples knew not that it was Jesus, and He said unto them,<br>
<b>"Children, have ye any meat?"</b> They answered him, No. And he said unto them,<br>
<b>"Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find." They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes." (John 21:5-6)</b><br><br>

Therefore, from the gospel of John as enumerated above, we discover that obedience of faith is the master key to the world of the miraculous.<br><br>

We therefore believe that because Israel came out of Egypt on the wings of signs and wonders, that as you align in obedience of faith to the revelation of the word, you are also coming out of every kind of Egypt. (<b>Ps. 105:26-44</b>; <b>Exo. 3:21</b>; <b>Exo. 12:36</b>)<br><br>

Also, because Israel came into the Promised Land – a land flowing with milk and honey – on the wings of signs and wonders, you are coming into your prophetic promised land. (<b>Deut. 26:8-9</b>)<br><br>

New birth is a birth into the supernatural world. When one is born again, he/she is born into a world of signs and wonders. Every child of God is a miracle in the world and to the world (<b>Zech. 3:8</b>).<br><br>

It is written,<br>
<b>"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved... and these signs shall follow them that believe..." (Mark 16:16-17)</b>.<br><br>

It is also written,<br>
<b>"the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth, so is everyone that is born of the Spirit" (John 3:8)</b>.<br><br>

When the first century apostles took the stage, the people exclaimed,<br>
<b>"the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men" (Acts 14:11)</b>.<br><br>

This is why the Word says prophetically concerning the redeemed,<br>
<b>"Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for signs and for wonders" (Isaiah 8:18)</b>.<br><br>

Anytime one is challenged and seems to have come to his wits’ end, people will always assert, ‘it will take a miracle’.<br>
What it will take for our trials to be turned into testimonies and our obstacles to miracles is right in our hands – a miracle.<br><br>

But every miracle is a confirmation of the Word. The Bible says,<br>
<b>"...the Lord also working with them and confirming the word with signs following" (Mark 16:20)</b>.<br><br>

It is also written that,<br>
<b>"...God gave testimony unto the Word of His grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands" (Acts 14:3)</b>.
</p>

        `],

    "praise": ["Praise",`<p>Every time thanksgiving goes up to heaven, we secure God’s attention in prayers; because when we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. (<b>Phil. 4:6</b>, <b>1 John 5:14</b>)</p>

<p>Therefore, remember:</p>

<ul>
    <li>No one ever gets stranded with thanksgiving (<b>John 6:6-11</b>)</li>
    <li>Praise will always provoke divine favour (<b>Mark 6:21-23</b>)</li>
    <li>Nothing is ever late with thanksgiving (<b>John 11:40-44</b>)</li>
    <li>It may appear stinking now; thanksgiving will turn it to sweet smelling savour (<b>1 Thess. 5:18</b>, <b>Heb. 10:38</b>)</li>
    <li>Praise will always culminate in supernatural harvest (<b>Ps. 67:5-7</b>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also remember, God still crowns the year with His goodness and all His paths drop fatness.</p>

<p>We must also be reminded that taking offenses in God is a risk, but thanksgiving and praise is a covenant cure for offenses (<b>Luke 17:1-2</b>, <b>Matt. 11:6</b>).</p>

<p>Hence, to take full delivery of our breakthrough agenda, the Word of God admonishes:</p>

<pre>
Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines;
the labour of the olives shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat;
the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:
Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
The LORD God is my strength, and He will make my feet like hinds' feet,
and He will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
—<b>Hab. 3:17-19</b>
</pre>

<p>In order for our harvest not to perish, we must maintain the joy of harvest through intensive thanksgiving and praise (<b>Joel 1:11-12</b>, <b>Isa. 9:3</b>).</p>

<p>Praise is a missing axe-head in the body of Christ today. The lack of the spiritual understanding of this weapon has incapacitated many Christians.<br>
Just imagine, how do you fell a tree with an axe that has no axe-head? (<b>2 Kings 6:5</b>)</p>

<p>We have misconstrued praise as a weapon of acknowledging God’s doings in our life—that is thanksgiving, that is not praise. Praise is a spiritual means of provoking divine intervention. It is not what we do after things have happened; it is what we do to make things happen.</p>

<p>And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten (<b>2 Chron. 20:22</b>).</p>

<p>This was the same experience that Paul and Silas had in the prison (<b>Acts 16:25-30</b>).<br>
King David—a praising giant—was also a gallant overcomer—he never lost any battle. David said, <b>"I will bless the LORD at all times: His praises shall continually be in my mouth" (<b>Ps. 34:1</b>, <b>Ps. 119:164</b>)</b>.</p>

<p>The following things happen when we praise God acceptably:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We invoke divine presence (<b>Ps. 22:3</b>)</li>
    <li>We provoke the release of the anointing for conquest (<b>Ps. 89:20-24</b>, <b>Ps. 92:10-15</b>)</li>
</ul>

<p>A combination of the presence and the power of God will bring down any mountain in our life. Praise is therefore a most vital force in the realm of the Spirit.</p>

<p>The same God who took over the battle of Jehoshaphat will take over the battle of individuals this month, and all our enemies shall be smitten, and not one of them shall escape (<b>2 Chron. 20:17-24</b>). But how can God take over what we did not hand over?</p>

<p>In the same vein, God who stepped into the prison of Paul and Silas will step into our prison and bring everyone out in colours (<b>Acts 16:25-30</b>).</p>

    "holy_spirit": ["The Holy Spirit",`
        <p>According to scriptures, every child of God:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Is born into a world of no-limits – <b>Jn 14:12</b>, <b>1 Jn 4:17</b>, <b>Mk 9:23</b>, <b>Mk 10:27</b>, <b>Deut 28:1-13</b>, <b>Matt 5:17</b></li>
    <li>Is born for the topmost top – <b>Rev 22:16</b> (<b>Jn 17:18</b>), <b>Dan 12:3</b> (<b>Matt 11:19</b>, <b>1 Cor 2:16</b>), <b>1 Kg 4:29-34</b> (<b>Matt 12:42</b>, <b>Jn 17:18</b>)</li>
    <li>Has an heritage of unending progress in life – <b>Prv 4:18</b> (<b>1 Cor 5:21</b>), <b>2 Cor 3:18</b> (<b>2 Cor 5:21</b>)</li>
    <li>His breakthrough as a seed of Abraham is as far as his eyes can see – <b>Gen 13:14-15</b>, <b>Is 51:1-3</b>, <b>Ps 119:18</b>, <b>Rev 3:17-18</b> (<b>Eph 1:17-18</b>/<b>Eph 3:8-11</b>)</li>
</ol>

<p>From all the above, every child of God is ordained to live in a world of no-limits.<br>
But as it was with Christ, even though He was conscious of His mission from the age of twelve, yet He could not deliver His mandate until He was empowered by the Spirit – <b>Lk 4:14-27/37</b>.<br>
Therefore, our golden destiny in this golden age of the church cannot be fully realized without the empowerment of the Spirit.<br>
The disciples also were under the teaching and mentorship of Christ for three and a half years, yet Jesus commanded them not to embark on their mission until they were endued with power from on high (<b>Lk 24:49</b>, <b>Act 1:8</b>).<br>
And after the empowerment of the Holy Ghost, they began to command unstoppable breakthroughs – <b>Acts 2:1-41/42-47</b>, <b>Acts 4:4</b>, <b>Acts 5:14</b>, <b>Acts 6:7</b>.<br><br>

From all the above, it is evident that supernatural breakthrough is impossible for any believer without the ministry of the Holy Ghost at work. But why? You may ask. This is because all the forces of supernatural breakthroughs are embedded in the Holy Ghost – <b>1 Cor 16:9</b>, <b>Lk 10:19</b>, <b>Ps 89:20-24</b>, <b>Ps 105:13-15</b>, <b>Eze 37:1-14</b>, <b>Num 11:31-33</b>.<br><br>

We all know that the only language the devil understands is the language of power. As it is written,<br>
<b>"Thou through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee" (Ps. 66:3)</b>.<br><br>

We also understand from scriptures that power is in degrees and anointing is in levels (<b>Ezek. 47:1-10</b>, <b>Ps. 45:6-8</b>).<br><br>

Why do we need power? We need power for the following reasons among others:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To fulfill our mission on the earth (<b>Lk. 4:14-18</b>, <b>Acts 1:8</b>)</li>
    <li>For protection (<b>Ps. 105:13-15</b>, <b>1 Pet. 1:5</b>)</li>
    <li>For victory over the battles of life (<b>Lk. 10:19</b>, <b>Ps. 66:3</b>)</li>
    <li>To command dominion (<b>Ps. 110:1-3</b>, <b>Is. 45:1-3</b>)</li>
    <li>To preserve the blessings of God on our lives (<b>Ps. 112:1-9</b>, <b>92:10-15</b>)</li>
</ol>

<p>But power is always released at a cost. However, it does not cost money, but it costs something much more demanding.<br>
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, But Peter said unto him,<br>
<b>"Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money" (Acts 8:18-20)</b>.<br><br>

Again in the parable of the ten virgins, when the five foolish virgins asked if they could be spared some oil,<br>
<b>"But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves" (Matt 25:9)</b>.<br><br>

Do you want to see more of God's power in your life? Do you want to grow in power? Then it will cost you the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>More consecration – (<b>Ps. 45:6-8</b>, <b>Lk. 5:37-38</b>, <b>Pr. 1:23</b>)</li>
    <li>A genuine thirst – (<b>Ps. 63:1-3</b>, <b>Is. 44:3-4</b>, <b>John 7:37-38</b>)</li>
    <li>More of fasting and prayer – (<b>Lk. 4:1-14</b>, <b>9:28-43</b>, <b>Matt. 17:20-21</b>)</li>
    <li>More attention to the word – (<b>Lev. 6:9-13</b>, <b>Acts 6:1-3</b>) etc.</li>
</ol>

        `],
    "healing": ["Healing",`
        <p>We understand from scriptures that until sin came, sickness was nowhere to be found. The first Adam knew no sickness before the fall. How do I know? You may ask.<br>
There was no provision made for his healthcare because sickness was not part of his nature. All the herbs were for his food, not for drugs. Therefore, when sin is gone, sickness becomes illegal. (<b>Gen 1:29</b>)</p>

<p>The Bible says,<br>
<b>"I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth" (3 John 2)</b>.<br>
When your soul is healthy, your body must be healthy also.</p>

<p>The price for our total health has been fully paid. It is therefore your covenant right to enjoy divine health. The Bible says,<br>
<b>"You have been bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s" (1 Cor. 6:20)</b>.<br>
And just like sin does not glorify God in the soul, sickness does not glorify God in your body.</p>

<p>The body of Christ is increasingly challenged by the spirit of infirmities in all forms.<br>
But,<br>
<b>"Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?" (Jer. 8:22)</b>.<br>
Christ is not only the savior of our soul; He is also the savior of our body (<b>Eph. 5:30</b>).</p>

<p><b>"And by His stripes, we were healed" (1 Peter 2:24)</b>.<br>
God said in His word,<br>
<b>"I am the Lord that healeth thee" (Exo. 15:26)</b>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we must recognize that God is committed to our total health; sicknesses and diseases are not our portion in His Kingdom.<br>
We must equally recognize that plagues and afflictions are not meant for us, and all forms of oppression of the wicked are illegal in our lives.<br>
God is saying that,<br>
<b>"It is our right in redemption to prosper and be in health" (3 John 2)</b>.</p>

<p>We should acknowledge that Christ Himself took our sicknesses and bore our infirmities (<b>Matt. 8:17</b>).<br>
And that by His stripes, we were healed (<b>1 Pet. 2:24</b>).<br>
Therefore, total health is our covenant right (<b>Exo. 23:25-26</b>; <b>John 15:1-5</b>).<br>
Long life is our heritage (<b>Isa. 65:20-24</b>; <b>Gen. 25:8</b>; <b>Gal. 3:13-14</b>; <b>Gal. 4:28</b>; <b>Ps. 91:16</b>).<br>
That death has no more legal power over our lives (<b>Heb. 2:14-15</b>, <b>1 Cor. 15:26</b>; <b>1 Cor. 15:55-57</b>; <b>Isa. 25:6-9</b>; <b>Hos 13:14</b>; <b>Exo. 12:12-13</b>).</p>

<p>Christ is our substitute in death as He was to Barabbas (<b>Luke 23:23-25</b>).<br>
We cannot have God as our healer and still remain bound in sickness; for with God all things are possible.</p>

<p>We must continue to expect the great physician to administer His balm on us and our household through the following channels among others:</p>

<ol>
    <li>By the Word (<b>Ps. 107:20</b>).</li>
    <li>By the Anointing (<b>Rom. 8:11</b>, <b>James 5:13-14</b>).</li>
    <li>By the Communion (<b>1 Cor. 11:23-30</b>, <b>John 6:48-58</b>).</li>
    <li>By Prophetic Impartations (<b>Acts 19:11-12</b>, <b>Rev. 12:1</b>).</li>
</ol>

        `],

    "success": ["Success",`
        <p>Remember, God’s Word says,<br>
<b>"The path of the just man is as the shining light that shines more and more unto the perfect day" (Proverbs 4:18)</b>.<br><br>

We understand from the above scripture that redemption provides us access to a realm of unending progress.<br>
God hates that we go in cycles. That is why He charged the Israelites, saying,<br>
<b>"Ye have gone around this mountain long enough, turn ye northwards..." (Deut. 2:3)</b><br><br>

It is our redemptive right:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To shine more and more unto the perfect day. (<b>Proverbs 4:18</b>)</li>
  <li>To go from strength to strength; that is, from exploits to exploits. (<b>Psalm 84:7</b>, <b>Dan. 11:32</b>)</li>
  <li>And to go from glory to glory. (<b>2 Cor. 3:18</b>)</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, in the words of Micah, the Prophet,<br>
<b>"Arise, ye and depart, for this is not your rest" (Micah 2:10)</b>.<br><br>

Arise; the best is yet to come.<br>
Arise, you are not there yet.<br>
Even Paul the Apostle, at the height of his exploits in ministry, said,<br>
<b>"Neither have I yet attained, but this one thing I do,... I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 3:13-14)</b>.<br><br>

It is time to press to the next level.<br>
It is time to break the failure and stagnation syndrome.<br>
It is time to break new frontiers in all our endeavors.<br><br>

Success is defined as getting results in successions; that is, improving on one’s level of success.<br>
Success implies continuous improvement on one’s results, which is God’s plan for us.<br>
Arise; don’t watch any aspect of your life go down the drain.<br><br>

We must recognize that our heritage of success is established on 3 vital platforms:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As a seed of Abraham, you are born to be a blessing to your world and not a burden. (<b>Gal. 3:13-14</b>, <b>Gen. 12:1-3</b>, <b>Gen. 22:17-18</b>)</li>
  <li>As a seed of Abraham, you are either a King or a Nation. (<b>Gen. 17:6-7</b>)</li>
  <li>As a seed of Abraham, you are to be envied as Isaac and not to be pitied. (<b>Gen. 26:12-14</b>, <b>Gal. 4:28</b>)</li>
</ol>

<p>Secondly, as a born-again child of God:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are born to be a pathfinder, a pacesetter, and a trail-blazer. (<b>Matt. 5:13-16</b>)</li>
  <li>As a child of God, you are a star. (<b>Rev. 22:16</b>, <b>John 17:18</b>)</li>
</ol>

<p>Thirdly, as an end-time Saint, the top is where you belong.<br>
<b>"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem" (Isaiah 2:2-4)</b>.<br><br>

As quoted verbatim in (<b>Micah 4:1-2</b>).<br><br>

Note that we are in the last days. Remember Peter was speaking in the days of Pentecost and referred to the prophecy in Joel that<br>
<b>"In the last days, it shall come to pass that; I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh..." (Joel 2:28)</b>.<br><br>

If 2,000 years ago should be referred to as the last days, then we must be in the latter end of the last days. It is the hour of the Church.<br>
The world will begin to look up to the Church for direction and solution in all areas of human endeavors in these last days.</p>
